    "Support Vector Machines is a versatile clasisfiction algorithm.  SVM has been used for character recognition, image recognition and in the biosciences for protien classification. It is effective with a high number of features, which we have here, and is memory efficient.  It may degarde in performance with a larger data sets though and so is a concern as we expand out the student idendification solution to the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes is another general purpose algorithm.  GaussianNB has been used extensively in text classification such as identifying spam email.  It has als been used in medical diagnosis.  It is highly scalebale which is important for our application.  It does assume independence of features which I am not sure is the case here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are attractive because the can be visuallized and the results interpreeted.  That is interesting in this case since we not only want to know if a student is likley to fail but we are also interested in knowing why.  Decisions trees handle numeric and categorical data well but are prone to overfitting and can be unstable with small changes in the training data resulting in big differences in the predictive model. Decision trees are used in many applications inlcuding finanance, astronomy for star classification and noise filtering, and in the biomedical sciences.\n",

The F-score was better than the GaussianNB Classifier and improved with increase in the training set size.  The Support Vector Classifier, although having slightly higher F-scores than the Decision Tree, showed degredation in perfomance as the training set size increased. The Decision Tree also has the advantage of being able to interpreet the results to see which features contribute most to the failure prediction."

    "The Decision Tree Classifier is probably the most intuitive classifier to understand as it closely follows the pattern of human logic.  As the name suggests, the prediction model can be described as a tree with many branches.  Each node of the tree represents a decision point that inspects one the features (e.g. travel time) and determines which of two branches to follow.  The subsequent nodes in the tree inspect other features and the branching continues until ultimately a decision is reached - in this case \"likely to fail\" or \"not likely to fail\".  The training process determines the structure of the tree, assigning a specific feature to each node and decision criteria for branching.  For example, the top node may be assigned to \"Sex - Male\".  The decision criteria would be \"true\" or \"false\" and branching would be set so that true follows one branch and false the other.   The prediction process simply involves “walking” the tree asking the question at each node (e.g. “is this person male”) and then following the appropriate branch until an outcome is reached. "
